# This script is called by the daemon, for every packet received,
# with the filename of the received packet as the argument
# (before the file is assembled and saved).
# The program checks the exit status of the script. If it is 1,
# then the file is not saved; otherwise (e.g., 0) it is saved.
# A tcl template for developing a more complete filter for this purpose,
# is the prefilter script.

# It is not installed nor activated by default. To activate
# the variable "prefilter" must be set in npemwind.conf to point
# to the location of this script.

# The script is called with the filename as argument,
# e.g., "swrrahnc.txt".
#
# This sample script just logs the name passed in the argument.

logger -t npemwind-filter "Received $1"

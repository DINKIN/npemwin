{"name":"Npemwin","tagline":"Emwin server","body":"Overview\r\n========\r\n\r\n**Npemwin** is an emwin server. It was designed to get its feed from a\r\nan *Nbsp* *Noaaport* server, but it can also be configured to get\r\nthe data from a standard byteblaster emwin server, a list of them,\r\nfrom an emwin serial device (WX12/13/14) or from the newer WX14 device.\r\nIn any case, it will turn serve standard *byte-blaster emwin* clients\r\nin the usual way.\r\n\r\nAll the files received are saved in a directory based on file type and\r\n*WFO ID*. Extensive facilities allow to call a script for each complete\r\nfile received for post-processing (alarms/notifications, database\r\ninsertion, and others). It can in turn serve any number of byte\r\nblaster clients, including of course other instances of **Npemwin**\r\nitself, and it can relay the data by ldm and nntp.\r\n\r\nIt can be configured to register itself with the NWS master host\r\nto be advertised as a *public emwin server* and appear in the list of\r\navailable servers. It has no hard-coded limits to the number of\r\nclients it can serve. The number can be limited in the run-time\r\nconfiguration file if desired. Clients can be dennied or allow\r\naccess through the tcpwrappers the */etc/hosts.allow* file. When used in\r\nthis way Npemwin tries to imitate the behaviour of\r\na regular *BB* server, as seen by either the *BB* clients, the *BB* servers\r\nor the master host.\r\n\r\nIt has a built-in web server for monitoring the internal state of\r\nthe server as well as displaying the files received using any web\r\nbrowser.\r\n\r\nBinary packages are available from\r\n\r\n  * http://www.noaaport.net\r\n  * http://bb.noaaport.net/npemwin/downloads\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTue Feb  5 13:46:46 AST 2013\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nStarting with version **2.4.1** Npemwin has a *mobile* web interface for better\r\ndisplay in mobile devices, e.g., smartphones and tablets. It can be accessed\r\nfrom the top-left corner of the main web page. In addition the *NNTP*\r\nhas been revised. More information in\r\n\r\n  * http://emwin.mobi\r\n  * http://www.iemwin.net\r\n  * http://bb.noaaport.net/npemwin-nntp\r\n\r\nSun Oct  7 18:34:46 AST 2012\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nStarting with version **2.3.1**, Npemwin supports reading from the\r\nWX14 device ethernet ports. The *servers.conf* file\r\nin the Npemwin configuration directory has the instructions\r\nfor enabling that configuration.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

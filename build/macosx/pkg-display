The configuration files are installed in

	/usr/local/etc/npemwin.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/npemwin, and already enabled the servers.conf file.
The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

Some common configuration options are indicated in various
sample configuration files in the /usr/local/etc/npemwin
directories and the defaults subdirectory.

The directory /usr/local/share/doc/npemwin contains
instructions for installing filters to process the files as they are
received.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/noaaport, and already enabled the rstfilter and dafilter.
In addition the web server is enabled by default, and can be
accesed as
	
	http://localhost:8016
or
	http://<hostname>:8016

The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

NOTE: The tcllib-1.8 that is included in MacOSX is not compatible
with npemwin. A package for tcllib-1.10 is available
in the optional-packages section.

NOTE: The launchd mechanism for starting daemons is not yet supported.
For the moment, the daemon can be started/stop in a more traditional way

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/npemwind {start|stop}

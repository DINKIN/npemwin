The configuration files are installed in /usr/local/etc/npemwin.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/npemwin, and already enabled the servers.conf file.
The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

Some common configuration options are indcated in various
sample configuration files in the /usr/local/etc/npemwin
directories and the defaults subdirectory.

The directory /usr/local/share/doc/npemwin contains
instructions for installing filters to process the files as they are
received.

An init script is installed to start automatically the program
at boot time, and stop when the system is shutdown.
It can also be started or stoped manually by executing

        /etc/init.d/npemwind start
        /etc/init.d/npemwind stop

It is advisable to use a cron job to keep the incoming files
directory from growing without limit; a sample script has been
installed in /etc/cron.hourly.

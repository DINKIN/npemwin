To enable the ldm gateway:

1) In the file features.conf

set features(ldmfilter) 1

2) In "ldmfilter.conf", verify that the $ldmfilter(pqinsert)
variable has the correct path to the pqinsert program.

3) Make the ldm.pq file

	chgrp noaaport ldm.pq
	chmod 664 ldm.pq

   Another option is to add in the ``npemwind.conf'' file

        set group "noaaport,ldm"

   and another one is to install ldm as user "noaaport:noaaport".

4) Start ldm, then start npemwin, in that order.

MetarWeather is a nice program for Windows, free,
available from www.nirsoft.net (in the ``Utilities'' section).
Support for MetarWeather is enabled by default.

The metar data from each station or collective is summarized and saved
in a file in the ``metarweather'' subdirectory of the noaaport data directory
and any of those files can simply be opened in MetarWeather
(assuming that the noaaport data directory is exported via samba).

Then from the MetarWeather program, the data is obtained by opening
the files that are in the subdirectory

	metar/metarweather

If a collective file is opened (for example Louisiana/Louisiana.txt),
then the last report from all the stations of the Lousiana collective
are displayed. If a particular station file is opened, then the last
reports from that station are displayed.

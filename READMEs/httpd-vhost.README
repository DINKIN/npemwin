As of version 2.2.1 the web server was revised to support the bytes tanges
http header and virtual hosts. The first is required by the new scheme
used by the GR warnings programs. The virtual host support now
makes it possible to use url's like

    http://warnings.opennoaaport.net:8016

instead of

    http://www.opennoaaport.net:8016/digatmos/warnings

The file

    dist/httpd-vhost.conf-ex

has explanations and examples of the virtual host configuration
syntax and options.

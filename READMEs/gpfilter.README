The ``gpfilter'' saves the data files in a Gempak compatible
layout, without the need to install and run ldm and the ldm filter.
The data directory is by default ``/var/npemwin/data/gempak''
and this must be set in the Gemenviron configuration file of the gempak
package. It is enabled by setting

set feature(gpfilter) 1

in the ``features.conf'' file in the npemwin configuration directory.

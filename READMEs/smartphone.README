This is a quick guide to sending sms messages (alerts) to smartphones.

1)  Enable the msgfilter

      set features(msgfilter) 1

2)  Two settings must appear in site/msgfilter.conf file:

      set msgfilter(smtp,originator) "nbsp@localhost";
      set msgfilter(http,server) "http://www.opennoaaport.net:8015";

    The first should be set to an email address that properly identifies
    the sending site, and the second one to the correct url of the
    site.

    If the smtp server (e.g., sendmail) is setup in the same computer where
    nbsp is running, then that is all. Otherwise this setting
 
      set msgfilter(smtp,servers)  "localhost";

    should be set to the appropriate smtp server to use, and 
     
      set msgfilter(smtp,options) [list];

    to set any options that may be required, such as

       set msgfilter(smtp,options) [list -username <u> -password <p>]

3)  The site/msgfilter.rc file should contain an instruction like

      lappend subscribers {
        smtp://7873467474@cingularme.com
        (svs|tor)
        U
      }

    The last entry (U) is a flag indicating to send a URL in the sms
    message, which is usually what you want. The other flags are either
    F (to send the full file) or S (to send a "summary"; currenty the
    first 1024 bytes are sent in that case).

4)  Consult the files

      dist/msgfilter.rc-ex

    and

      msgfilter.README

    for the explanation of the regular expression syntax to select the
    files to send.

5)  These and some SMS gateways that I am aware of

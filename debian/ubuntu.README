The debian package can be used in Ubuntu as well.

The tcllib-1.8 that is included in Ubuntu is not compatible
with npemwin. A compatible tcllib package will be available
in the optional-packages section (soon).

For the moment, create the directory /usr/local/share/tcltk
(if it does not exist) and then unpack file tcllib-1.11-share.tgz and move
the entire directory tcllib1.11 to /usr/local/share/tcltk.
The final directory should be

	/usr/local/share/tcltk/tcllib1.11

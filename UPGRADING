UPGRADE NOTES -

1) Starting with version 2.0, Npemwin can be upgraded easily.
The first thing is to install the nbspadm package for your OS.
That package contains the program _nbspupdate_ which is used as follows.
Executing

	nbspupdate npemwin

without arguments, will check the version of the installed Npemwin package
against the latest one available, and if the latter is newer than the
former it will download it. The Npemwin package can then be upgraded
manually as usual. Alternatively, executing

	nbspupdate -u npemwin

will do the upgrade automatically after downloading the package as above.
By passing the [-F] option as well, i.e.,

	nbspupdate -u -F npemwin

nbspupdate will do as above, even if the installed version is the same
as the latest one, or if Npemwin had not been installed before.

2) Starting with version 2.0.r2, npemwin runs as the user
"noaaport", and therefore the directories where the daemon writes
must be owned by that user:

    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/npemwin
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/log/npemwin
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/run/npemwin

During a fresh install, the package installer will create the
directories with the appropriate ownership, but not during an upgrade.
If you are uprading from an older version, those commands must be
executed manually.

The file ``npemwind.conf-nonpriv'' is a sample file with
configuration instructions for running npemwind as a non-root
user; e.g., emiwn:emwin. It is important to follow also the instructions
explained there to set the owner and group of the directories

	/var/npemwin
	/var/run/npemwin

For example

	chown -R <user>:<group> /var/npemwin
	chown -R <user>:<group> /var/run/npemwin

replacing <user> and <group> with the appropriate names.

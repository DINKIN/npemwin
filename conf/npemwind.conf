# Configuration file for npemwind
# 
# This configuration file uses the tcl language. 
# All options are commented out. What they show are the default
# values hard-coded in the program. 

# npemwind will run as the user specified below, unless those variables
# are unset, in which case it will run as the user that starts
# the program (usually root). If the user and group options are set,
# then the commands equivalent to the following must be executed
# (with the correct user:group)
#
#	chown -R user:group /var/npemwin
#	chown -R user:group /var/run/npemwin
#

# user and group to run as, and the default umask

The npemwind daemon saves the files temporarily in the spool directory

	/var/npemwin/files

before sending them to the various filters for processing. The retention
time in that spool directory is short (a couple of days in the default
configuration) so, in effect the raw data files do not live too long
in the system.

The ``spoolfilter'' is designed for those situations that require
the raw data files to be kept around for longer periods. The spoolfilter
simply saves a copy of each raw data file in a directory tree that is rooted
at

	/var/npemwin/data/spool/files

called the "secondary" spool directory. In the default configuration,
the spoolfilter creates subdirectories named like 20080521 (yyyymmdd)
and saves all the files of a given day in the corresponding
subdirectory. Therefore, every raw data file is permanently retained,
unless some further action (outside of npemwin) is taken.

The spoolfilter is not enabled by default, but it can enabled in the
``features.conf'' file. The above scheme in terms of the full days date
can be modified in the spoolfilters.conf file to, for example,
use only the day of the month or day of the week.

The spoolfilter should not be enabled without planning ahead.
Moreover, there is no default mechanism installed to purge old files
from the secondary spool directory. If that is desired, it must be
implemented outside of npemwin.

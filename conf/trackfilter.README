The ``trackfilter'' collects the data from the NHC bulletins
and plots the tracks and forecasts of each hurricane.
It is enabled by setting

set feature(trackfilter) 1

in the ``features.conf'' file. It uses GrADS to draw the plot and
therefore that package must have been installed. If GrADS is not
installed, the plot can be disabled by setting

set trackfilter(grads_enable)        0;

in ``trackfilter.conf''. In those case the filter only collects
the data and saves in the data files in the ``/var/npemwin/data/track''
directory that can be used with other programs if desired.

The data and the plots are accesible from the web interface.

Packages for Grads are avalable in the noaaport.net site.

Npemwin
=======

- Basic usage

      ./npemwinbatch.tcl update -c noaaport.uprrp.edu:8016

When run the first time, that simply retrieves the "current" inventory
file, and then the files listed there.

Aterwards, it downloads all the inventory files and data files listed on them,
since the last time that it was executed.

The script can be scheduled to run every minute, of every five or two minutes,
whatever is convenient.

- More advanved usage is illustrated in the companion script npemwinbatch.sh.
  
  That assumes

  1) It is run by root, or a user that can write to /var/npemwin
  2) Npemwin has been installed in the machine (the script will invoke
  the postfilter to process the downloaded data files).

  The npemwinbatch.sh script (or a variation of it) can be scheduled
  periodically. It will download the data as above, and then process it
  through the postfilter in the same way that the npemwin qrunner does.

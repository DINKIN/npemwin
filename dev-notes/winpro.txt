<p>The EMWIN datastream consists of NWS weather products and other data files.
Each product or file, whether ASCII text or binary data, is divided into 1 KB
packets and sent as a series of async 8-bit bytes, N parity. For example, most
current EMWIN <a href="http://www.weather.gov/emwin/winrad.htm">Radio</a>
broadcasts are receivable, when demodulated, as async 1200,8,N,1 while the <a href="http://www.weather.gov/emwin/winsat.htm">Satellite</a> broadcasts are
async 9600,8,N,1. </p>

<p>Each product or file is sent as one or more packets, which are numbered 1..N
within the given product. Because the data is packetized, a particular product
can be gracefully interrupted by a high priority warning or alert product and
then resume. Note: the broadcast is receive-only -- hence the receiver has no
means of notifying the transmitter of any block errors or of requesting
retransmission of individual blocks. Instead each product is usually
transmitted at least twice, to "fill in" any blocks received in
error. </p>

<p>Each packet of data contains 1116 bytes, in the following fields: </p>

1. 6 bytes of ASCII 0 (null) to clear the receiver buffer.
2. "/PF" followed by an 8-character filename, a period, and a 3- character
   filetype.
3. "/PN" followed by the block number -- the number of this block (1..N)
   within this file.
4. "/PT" followed by the total number of blocks (N) being sent for this file.
5. "/CS" followed by a checksum number -- the sum of all bytes in the 1024-byte
   data portion of this packet, as a 16-bit unsigned decimal.
6. "/FD" followed by the date/time stamp of this file --
   in the format of: MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS AM, without space padding.
7. ASCII 32 (SP) fill -- to pad the total bytes in fields 2..8 to a full line
   of 80 bytes.
8. ASCII 13 (CR) and ASCII 10 (LF) to enhance readability.
9. the data, as a 1024-byte block; if the remaining data of the product is
   less than 1024 bytes, this block is null-filled so that each packet's data
   block is always 1024 bytes long.
10. 6 bytes of ASCII 0 (nullNUL) to clear the receiver buffer.

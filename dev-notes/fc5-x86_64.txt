Solution [Sun Jul 16 16:19:23 AST 2006] -

I first added the call to Tcl_FindExecutable in main(), but that
did not solve the problem. I left that there anyway since the
documentation recommends (specifies?) it.

Then in tclconf.c I substituted the free() for the tcl ckfree()
function in  kill_confopt_table() and that did solve it.

You are correct, I don't see any core files anywhere. I finally got GDB
to attach to the child process that "npemwind" spawns, and I get the
following: 

(gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
Attaching after fork to child process 30930.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

I think that this free() call is coming from:
libtclconf/tclconf.c:void kill_confopt_table(struct confoption_st *opt){

Hope this helps.
